# Virtual_Pen_fingertip_skin_based

A real time skin colour based computer vision project where a person can sketch/draw on the screen using his/her hand.

The machine will recognise the hands on the basis of skin colour, and after performing certain operations, you will be able to use your fingertip as a pen to draw on the screen.
With the help of OpenCV package, the system quickly and easily detects the fingertip and start drawing, but this leads to an issue that the system will keep on drawing until it sees a hand in the box, and it doesn't stop even when we want it to stop.

To overcome this issue, an additional functionality is added which enables the system to stop drawing when a person raises his thumb upwards(like L-shape or V-shape formed using index finger and thumb).
